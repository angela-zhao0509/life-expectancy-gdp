## Relationship between Life Expectancy and GDP per capita

<b>Research Question</b>
- The globalization and colonization shapes the depolarization of the world in economy;
- The inequality between global south and global north is our focus in this research.


<b>Ethical Issues</b>
- Official data source and Macro-level dataset;
- Historical data without racial and sexual bias


<b>Connection to the Data</b>
- We analysis life expectancy and GDP per capita to see their relationship.
- We also compare life expectancy in developed countries and developing countries to see if there is any difference under different developing status.


<b>Explanations of Visualization</b>
- Variable Expectancy: Histograms of life expectancy and GDP per capita, Boxplot of life expectancy in terms of status;
- Covariation: Scatterplot showing positive relation between life expectancy and GDP per capita among all countries and for both developing and developed countries separately. 


<b>Confidence</b>
- Highly confident about the accuracy;
- Reasons: datasets from WHO, holistic visualizations (country types, continents, years)


<b>Limitations</b>
- Without considering geological factors;
- Only based on the data collected in 2000-2015
